# Getting Better (and Worse) ======================================
whenever a character achieves a goal significant to the campaign or the character themself the GM may allow them to *Get Better*  
(It also must make sense for the char to get better! No learning microbiology during a deseart advanture!)  

roll a __d3__:  
1 - the character gains a positive and negative *Trait*   
    __example__: You're better at shooting but worse within in rooms.  
    __or__: You're better at Strength, but cannot react quickly.

2 - Increase the **Luck Point** Max Cap by 1.    

3 - the most used skill increases one step (never above d10);   
    (or recently learned) if the skill cannot increase choose another.   

The Character also becomes *Rusty* in their least used skill (Stackable).  
While *Rusty* the skill decreases by 1 step for the next 5 tests, after which one stack of *Rusty* is removed.  


# Luck Points =================================
A **Luck Point** may be given to a player by the GM as kind of a "Best Roleplayer/Strategist/Whatever" award.  
They will be given sparingly, and are NON-STACKABLE.  

You may use a __Luck Point__ to:  (All are in some way modified by luck)
- Return from an **Uncertain** death with an unlikely explanation.   
- Gain your Luck *$MOD* to the next __d6__ rolls.   
- add __d10__ to a roll.  
- Neutralize a Fumble.  
- Cause a Positive event from the table to happen, But the GM 'gains a luck point' to cause a negative event in teh future  
- All party members use a luck point to cause a positive event to happen.
