# How ya'll play? 
Discord. Full ``theatre of the mind``

# Players 
We've got 2 players + the GM, looking for one more. *Could* I guess squeeze in another.


Realistic-ish SCIFI. Slow Burn Roleplay while jammin to tunes of Space Rock and Stoner Doom. 
HIGHLY improvised, and just here to chill and have fun. 
Looking for players that would actually be engaged in the campaign, if ya flake I will personally slap ye!
Bonus Points if ye bring some extra tunes.  
Also yer expected to be at least slightly experienced, we wanna chill, not explain the same 4 rules ten times over.
