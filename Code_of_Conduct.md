This is where all of the base session rules and the social contract are outlined.  
**Follow Them Please**  

# Keep er Clean
NSFW jokes n shit are all fine, we're all adults after all, don't take it too far tho.  
If ye REALLY want to, then all of it must be fade to black.  

In character fine Racism, Homophobia, all that stuff is ok, as long as everyone else is fine with it    
Just dont be Jan    


# Cooperate
Don't just make a character that's an absolute arsonist, or a very edgy loner.  
This is a COOPERATIVE game, and being an absolute cuck is the exact opposite of cooperation.  
No Rules Lawyering, or hogging the spotlight for half a session.   

Wait for the other players and GM to finish talking before ye start.   
Don't want everyone talkin over each other.  


# Immersion
Do not play video games, check social media, or in any other way get distracted.    
I don't want to hear "oh I was just texting someone, could ye repeat?" or someone showing a meme they found to other players.  
Minor jokes n stuff are fine but don't take it too far.   
Don't sit in a room with like 4 people talking to each other, keep background noise down.    
Don't make weird noises for the sake of it, or use the Discord soundboard.  

Im sick and tired of ya'll not knowing what happened 10min ago.  
Listen maybe? if ye Don't like it, ye can always leave  

Don't frequently break character to say like a tiny joke or somethin, we don't wanna hear it.  
Also try describing your actions in first person. "I do X" rather than "He does X".  
When you speak, everything is in character unless explicitly stated  

Additionally unless you actually Roleplay something happening: it didn't.
Describe what you're doing, instead of saying you did it, and calling it a day.


# Being Late
If you're gonna be late and/or not gonna arrive let me, and other players know a day in advance.  
Unless it's a REAL emergency don't just not arrive without a word.  
And no "I had to walk my dog" or "I was stuck in traffic" is not an emergency, ye can plan around those.  
Unless you're an emergency care surgeon and you get called, its not an excuse.  
Doin this three times will have ye kicked out.

If ye at any point wish to leave the campaign, give me and other players a notice of at least 2 weeks.  
Additionally please speak out about the reasons that you're quitting and the ways to make it better.  


# Actions
Roll dice however ye want, Physical is Preffered.  
If ye wanna show me that ye "actually rolled X", don't, I believe you.  
No rolling before I tell you to do so, if you do,   
You will not be allowed to roll anything till the end of session.  

Once the dice are rolled there is no going back on what you said. Double check EVERYTHING before you do.
Additionally, while this is a roleplay oriented campaign, Character deaths can still happen if you aren't at least a bit careful.  
ABSOLUTELY no undoing anything EVER.

If I tell you "no you can't do that" ye just gotta accept it. 
I don't wanna hear any "but ackshually it says here that during sunday aftern...". just no.


# Other
If you need to you may request a break. The usual time is 5-10 minutes, possibly 15min in situations of note.
Don't leave the session outside of a break, and if ye REALLY have to, TELL US.

Have some kind of food and drink prepared. Mute if you do snack on something for obvious reasons.

Be familiar with this document, the system rules, and have a general idea what are the other player's characters.
No checking rules mid-play, I will make a call and we'll check during break or after the session.

Write important stuff down on a piece of paper. You may write it down digitally, but if ye do so KEEP A BACKUP.
Do not rely on other players or the GM to do so for you.
I don't wanna hear "can ye give me a recap of the whole campaign, I kinda missed that"

This needs no mentioning: Dont cheat.
