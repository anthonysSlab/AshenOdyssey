This is where all of the base session rules and the social contract are outlined.
**Follow Them Please**

# Sex Stuff
A bit is fine, don't take it too far tho.

# Racism, Homophobia, Transphobia, &c
At some level fine *in character* as long as everyone's okey with it.

# Sane Character Creation
Don't just make a character that's an absolute douche to everyone, or a siper edgy loner.
this is a COOPERATIVE game, and being an absolute cuck is the exact opposite of cooperation.

# Distractions
Do not play video games, check social media, or in any other way get distracted (or cause other players to get distracted).
I don't want to hear "oh I was just texting someone, could ye repeat?" or someone showing a meme they found to other players.
Minor jokes n stuff are fine, as long as they're at least in some part session related, but don't take it too far
Additionally don't sit in a room with like 4 people talking to eachother, keep background noise down.
# Soundboard
No Comment.

# Don't be THAT guy
no Rules Lawyering, ,or hogging the spotlight for half a session

# Give a notice 
If you're gonna be late and/or not gonna arrive let me, and other players know a day in advance.
Unless it's a REAL emergency don't just not arrive without a word.
and no "I had to walk my dog" or "I was stuck in traffic" is not an emergency, ye can plan around those.

# Leaving
If ye at any point wish to leave the campaign give me and other players a notice of at least 2 weeks.Additionally speak out about the reasons that you're quitting and the possible ways of fixing stuff.

# Talking over eachother
Wait for the player or GM to finish talking before ye start. 

# Rolling n Stuff
Roll dice however ye want, Physical is Preffered.
If ye wanna show me that ye "actually rolled X", don't, I believe you.
No rolling before the GM tells ye to do so together with the $mod applied.

# No Going Back
Once the dice are rolled there is no going back on what you said. Double check EVERYTHING before you do.
Additionally, while this is a roleplay oriented campaign character deaths can still happen if you aren't at least a bit careful.
Also no trying to convince me to undo something, if ye f'd up ya gotta live up to it.

# Accept a NO 
If I tell you "no you can't do that" ye just gotta accept it. I don't wanna hear any "but ackshually it says here that during sunday aftern...". just no.

# Cheating
Just... Don't? 
Can't believe I have to actually write this, but ye, that still happens.

# Bookkeeping
Write important stuff down on a piece of paper. You may write it down digitally, but if ye do so KEEP A BACKUP.
Do not rely on other players or the GM to do so for you.
I don't wanna hear "can ye give me a recap of the whole campaign, I kinda missed that"

# Remember stuff
Be familiar with this document, the system rules, and have a general idea what are the other player's characters.
No checking rules mid-play, I will make a call and we'll check during break or after the session.

# Breaks
If you need to you may request a break. The usual time is 5-10 minutes, possibly 15min in situations of note.
Don't leave the session outside of a break unless in EMERGENCIES

# Food n Drink
Have some kind of food and drink prepared. Mute if you do snack on something for obvious reasons.
