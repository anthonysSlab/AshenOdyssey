<!DRAFT 0.2.4>  

# World General ================================================  
No stars or galaxies outside of the Local Group have ever been visited.  
<30% of the Local Group is Currently Occupied, although some factions claim this number to be larger.  

Ship combat isn't like in Star Wars or most popular fiction. It usually occurs at much greater distances from which the enemy fleet cannot be seen by the naked eye.  

A lot of this directly taken or extrapolated from Rimworld, as the world there is very close to my vison.  

## Units:  
AU - Astronomical Unit: The Average distance from Old Earth it's Sun. A light year is about 63.2kAU.  
pc - Parsec: Equal to about 0.2MAU  

# Tech =========================================================  

# Energy Production  

## Solar:  
- HTOPC; (High Tunnel Oxide Passified Contact):  
    Lossy by Design but able of high output, and long life in harsh conditions.  

- PMERC; (Polimer Matrix Emitter Rear Contact):  
    Highly efficient but also fragile and with a shorter life span.  
    Too High production meal lead to overheating, and so they are best used in areas with less light.  

## Fusion:  
- DTDC; (Deuterium-Tritium Doped Collector):  
    Highest energy output as well as cost of fuel, heat of operation, Startup Draw, and Danger Involved  
    Best suited for Great Output applications with High meinteinability.  

- D-D; (Deuterium-Deuterium):  
    While the most basic type of fusion it proves to be the safest, Cheapest, and most stable one.  
    This is the most common on Majority of Manned Spacecraft.  

- NTIS; (Neutron-Tritium Inverse Substitution):  
    An experimental type being a mix of Fusion and Fission.  
    It involves Neutrons croduced by Fissile Material being Fused with Tritium in the Main Reactor.  
    While this makes it the Most Efficient, The Extreme Danger and Cost of operation make it a rare pick in most cases.  
    Additionally because of the way of operation it produces Exponentially More Energy than it's given.  
    This makes it Additionally Dangerous given that if less than 30% of it's power output is being used, the Fissile material might become Supercritical.  

## Fission:  
Fissile Energy production has been phased out for the most cases. The only large scale reactors are used for the processing of Radioisotopes (ex U238 + n -> U239 -> Np239 -> Pu239)  
- RTG; (Radioisotobe Thermoelectric Generator):  
    A time tested classic, the RTG is able of uninterrupted power generation for ~90y after being created  
    The main disadvantage of this solution is the low energy production of 2kJ/s or 2kW.  

## Minor:  
- Wind  
- Hydroelectric  
- Geothermal  

## Transmission:  
    For most High Current applications Cryocooled Superconductors are used.  
    Their cost and need of Cryogenic temperatures makes them impractical for long range transmission tho,  
    in which steel reinforced annealed copper wires are used.  

# Weapons && Munitions  

## Plasma:  
    Plasma Based weapons usually offer Better Penetration of Materials,  
    with the Trade-offs of Abyssmal Penetration on High Melting Point materials and Low Stopping Power.  
    Counter intuitively Plasma Weapons have Worse Incindiary capabilities due to the Short Projectile Lifetime.  
    These Weapons also offer virtually no recoil, making them ideal for Infantry.  
- Cannon:  
    Slow and Heavy. Designed for Mounted Operation. It's Long Range, High accuracy, and Low Dropoff make it Ideal for Focused Barrages meant to completely Destroy a single Target.  

- Rifle:  
    A single Shot Rifle. It's Low price of Opperation and energy consumption make it the standard issue weapon for most militaries  

- Pistol:  
    Classic Weapon for Self Defence and Onboard Combat. Due to It's lighweight and Robust construction it is the most common to see on non-miliraty vessels.  

- LMG; (Light Machine Gun):  
    While it offers fast fire rates it is not without it's diadvantages.  
    Because of the Sheer Temperature of plasma it overheats rapidly when used and needs Frequent Pauses in firing to avoid the Destruction of the Barrel.  
    Additionally the Insane power draw requires the firer to wear a Power Cell backpack to allow for Longer durations of usage.  
    While It is designed for Rapid Fire Rate most models also offer a Single Shot Mode.  

- HMG; (Heavy Machine Gun):  
    While slower than the LMG it's Superheated and Heavy Projectiles make up for it in Penertation.  
    Being able to pierce most types of Armour.  
    Unfortuanately that comes with a need of cryo-cooling the weapon and extreme power draws, making it implactical to use without mounting.  

- Plasmaswords:  
    Not ACTUALLY Plasma, They Posess a Superheated edge made of Tungsten-Iridium-Carbide Alloys that keeps it's Strength even while Heated. The usual Temerature they reach is 7000K.  
    While the Sword is passively cooled by modules within it prolonged usage may lead to damages.  

- Plasma Crossbows:  
    Same as the swords, but the crossbow itself heats up the Tips of the Bolts to Extreme Temperatures.  
    This Reduces the Fire Rate but increases the Fire Power Immensely.  
    Capable of Shooting literally anything that will fit. Your Milage may vary tho.  

## Laser:  
    Laser Weapons offer a stellar shield penetrating capabilities, but are only effective against infantry Due to their low Material Penetration.  
    Being Laser Weapons they Can be stopped by Thick Smoke or Physical Cover.  

- Rifle:  
    A burst rifle capable of prelonged operation. Best Suited for Crowd Control and Suppression.  

- Automated Weapons Systems:  
    Most laser weapons are used as an effective crowd control method because of their abillity to be scattered. They also aren't as good at killing the target, instead disabling it's  

## Missile:  
    While Missiles Ignore Shields, High Power Shields ones are able to jam the Electronics of Guided ones.  
- TCHEAT; (Tandem-Charge High Explosive Anti-Tank):  
    Small Missiles Meant to be Shot from Batteries with great armour piercing capabilities over an area.  

- Guided Missile:  
    While Guided Missiles posess the advantage of a low miss chance, reduced need for targeting equipment, and ability to target weak spots on the fly. They also posess the disadvantage of the ablility of them being hacked, or disabled by the enemy forces.  
    - HEFSATGM; (High Explosive Fin Stabilized Anti-Tank Guided Missile)  
    - HEIGM; (High Explosive Incindary Guided Missile)  
    - ASBGM; (Anti-Ship Ballistic Guided Missile):  
        A Small Nuclear missile meant to Destroy Spacecraft by destroying the most important targets.  
        Extremally effective against small Ships as a single missile is usually able to destroy them in their entirety.  

- Recoilless Infantry Launchers  

## Gauss:  
Shoot Magnetic Slugs by accelerating them with coils. Cheep to Fire, as Well as the Safest out of all of them.  
They have fairly liited range but Because of the Slugs high mass they pack a punch.  
While they do require power, the actual draw is so low that it can be ignored for most use cases.   
Their close-to-silent operation and little to no recoil make them portable, and well suited for training.  

## Autocannons:  
- HDSPAPFSDS; (High Density Solid Propelled Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot):  
    After Being shot the outer casing falls apart revealing a dart shaped rod of Depleted Uranium tipped with Hardened Tungsten Alloy,  
    Packed with Rocket fuel at the end. This increases the energy of the projectile DRASTICALLY.  
    This is The Only Kinetic Penetrator for Space Warfare still in Production.  

## Railgun:  
    A Massive gun able to accelerate projectiles to speeds close to %50 the speed of light.  
    Which allows it to reach extreme ranges and accuracies.  
    The Projectiles are often Heavy Slugs of Depleted Plutonium Alloy Encased within a Larger Graphite Rod.  
    It is usually single-shot, but some variants are able of Burst Fire.  
    Due to it's insane power draw, size, and need of cooling with Liquid Hydrogen it is usually only found on large motherships.  

## Physical:  
The most robust and time tested. While they're able to ignore Shields, they're usually ineffective against any spacecraft's armour. Additionally their use within ships is usually prohibited as a missed shot can cause fatal damage to the ship's systems.  

These Need no introduction as they haven't changed much since the discovery of Plasma Weaponry.  

- Rifles  
- Anti-Material Weapons  
- SMG's  
- LMG's  
- MMG's  
- HMG's  
- Granade Launchers  
- Scatterguns  
- Hand Mortars  

- CIWS; (Close In Weapons System):  
    Think: Turrets but REALLY Heavy. Usually used for automatic anti air and Anti missile Defense.  
    Most are able to track multiple targets at once and choose the most important one to target.  
    Hydraulic Heavy Rotary Machine Guns and Rotary Autocannons are the most common in this application.  


# Utility Devices:  

## Shielding:  
    A concentrated Ion shield able to Dissrupt Energy Projectiles.  
    High Power ones might Also dissrupt the guidance systems of missiles.  
    The energy from the plasma projectiles is Dissapated at the device, and so most need Cryocooling, and are prone to overheating.  
    Works BOTH WAYS.  

## HMPP; (High Momentum Particle Projector):  
    Projects an invisible cloud of High momentum particles within an Arc.  
    Which collide with physical projectiles and slow them down.  
    While they may also be Layered to stop projectiles Completely, every one would multiply the Power Draw,  
    Making this only viable for large ships and as emergency protection.  
    In extreme cases this might shread incoming projectiles.  
    Usually less effective against Self-Propelled Weaponry.  
    Oh it produces deadly doses of radiation btw :)  

## Cloaking:  
    An Optical Frequency Jammer able to completely hide the user at high enough ranges.  
    The efficiency drops off the closer the opponent is.  
    The device consumes large amounts of power to accomplish this.  

Low Power Infantry Personell Versions also exist, usually contained within a belt.  


# Energy Storage:  

## MISFR; (Minimified In Situ Fusion Reactor):  
    Not REALLY an energy STORAGE device. It uses a minified D-D Fusion Reactor.  
    While they Supply High amounts of Power they don't posess high energy storage.  
    Recharge times are usually 30s-5min.  

## CITFC; (Compressed Ion Thin-Film Collector):  
    Uses Compressed Hydrogen Ions to store it's charge.  
    This allows them to have the power draw only limited to the conductor used and the collector film's strength, ie: Discharge/Charge times are 10-50ns.  

## GrAPol Battery; (Graphine-Asthetine Polimer Battery):  
    High Weight/Energy factor, but Low Discharge/Charge Rate and Cherge Efficiency Decreases Exponentially.  
    This is the most common kind because of their price and heavy duty.  

## TFRT Cell; (Thick Film Radioisotope Thermoelectric Cell):  
    Produces Energy buy the slow decay of Radioisotopes of Plutonium, Neptunium, or Iodine.  
    They offer a Long lifetime (~5y) but low Power Generation.  
    May be recharged by the exposure to a stream of neutrons, Usually produced by Fission Reactors.  
    Usually used in Tandem With other cells to form Self-Recharging Batteries.  

## MSEC; (Muon Stabilized Entropy Collector):  
    Harvests the Energy of Quantum Fluctualtions. Requires a Separate Power Supply To Function.  


# Medicine  
    Due to the Great Advancements in Medicine most lives have been at least doubled in duration.  

## Cryosleep:  
    Cryosleep, A way to syspend a being in a type of stasis, keeping it unaging.  
    After a creature wakes up from it, it experiences symptoms of so called: cryosleep sickness.  
    Nusea, Weakness, Frequent Blackouts, lower Heart Rate, Low Blood Oxygen; Those are just a few of the symptoms.  
    It lasts from a day day to anytwhere to two weeks.  

## CNAC; (Confined Nanite Application Cell):  
    A medical preparation of Nanites, Able to Repair External injuries.  
    They lack at the ability to cure diseases or repair internal injuries, making them only good for stopping bleeding or fixing minor injuries.  

## APMN; (Additive Persistant Medical Nanobots):  
    A Nanite Infusion, usually in the form of Tablets. It is fully redistributed within the user's body in under an hour.  
    It is able to Kill Diseases, Internal and Extrenal Injuries, and Even Remove Scars and Slowly Restore Limbs.  
    This tho Comes with A Large Side Effect. Because of it's Whole-Body Form of Action it, in can slowly cause brain damage, Cancer, and Reproductive Disfunction.  

## <!TODO> add a drug that helps against cybernetic enduced psychosis

## Luciferium:  
    GREATLY Inproves ALL Bodily functions and can slowly heal brain damage and restore limbs.  
    Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: It is Insanely Additctive. Once Taken it must be taken at least every week until the user's death.  
    Failure to supress the need with more, causes disasterful withdrawl symptoms:  
    Firstly Frequent Mental Breaks, Nusea, and Vomitting. Later Insane Agressivness, madness, and the want to do anything for even a single crum of the devil's drug.  
    Longer Lasting Withdrawl may even lead to Death.  

## Flake:  
    A Flakey White solid. It can be smoked to enduce a short euphoric high.  
    It's easy to produce, and extremely pleasurable, it is also quite Additctive.  
    Flake is known for destroying lives and entire communities.  

obvously all the fun real world shit, which there's too many to list.  


# Transport:  

## Xenon Engines:  
    Use Xenon plasma to produce thrust. Operation within an Atmosphere is impossible.  
    Consume Mid amounts of electric energy.  

## HDSRE; (High Density Solid Rocket Engine):  
    Used On most Missiles and Probes. They're a Fail-Safe option and Require no Additional Components.  
    Usually composed of a single stage that is burned a single time to produce high amounts of thrust.  

## Combustive Engines:  
    Usually Hydrogen-Oxygen Engines. They're the main Engines of Most Ships.  

## Decomposition Engines:  
    Produce Thrust by the Chemical Decomposition of a Material.  
    While They're Durable and Don't produce Heat,  
    their low thrust makes them mainly used for landing and manuvering  

## XHEM Drive:  
    A Warp Dive. Uses Insane Amounts of energy Discharged over a few nanoseconds into a collection of antimatter,  
    Producting a strong curve in spacetime which allows for travel relatively faster than the speed of light.  
    they're very FRAGILE tho, and damage to them can lead to an antimatter discharge. Anihilating anything in radius.  


# Communications && Cryptography:  

## Encryption:  

## AESI; (Advanced Communications Standard Improved):  
    The standard encryption used in all communications.  
    An improved version of the AES standard which became obsolete with the rise of Quantum Computing.  
    It's usually the BARE MINIMUM encryption as most onboard systems forbid users from sending plaintext data.  
    It uses an shared secret key that is regenerated every packet, using the sender's private key.  
    This is a very basic encryption standard, being able to protect against low level Man in the Middle attacks.  

## PQWGC3; (Post-Quantum WireGuard Canary 3):  
    While this is the Most Secure out of all Algorythms Availble it's low speed and massive computing power requirements make it a rare pick.  
    It uses a 1024M bit key generated using a PQCSPRNG (Post-Quantum Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator),  
    that is then interpolated with noise collected from the background radiation.  
    The key is then Regenerated every 1-32 bytes based on a synchronised Fluctuations Collector.  
    Additonbally it contains AESI encrypted Canary Checksums to alert the recipient if the message is altered.  

## Spacefish IM; (Spacefish Improved):  
    A Post-Quantum Open Encryption Standard commonly used to securely encrypt traffic.  
    Depending on packet length it uses 4-32 interpolated subkeys, and repeats the InitHello packet every 2-4.  
    Due to it's design it is MUCH faster when encrypting, than decrypting.  

## ERUPT-8:  
    An Efficient Encryption Algorythm designed for Longer Lasting Connections.  
    It performs a multiplexed and AESI Encrypted single key 8Tb exchange just after the InitHello Packet.  
    Due to the Massive Key size the time to establish a connection can reach as high as 4 days, and the key has to be physically uploaded onto all of the Devices,  
    This also means that the key is nearly unbreakable and once established the connection can efficiently work for years.  
    Additionally the algorythym contains a hashed Dstr packet to allow all the keys to self destruct once one of the devices detects that it is compromised.  

## Transmitters/Recievers/Transceivers:  
(I will call all *Transmitters*, keep in mind I'm reffering to all at once.)  
The Range of Transmission is almost infinitevely variable based on the transmitter power, celectrial objects in path, &c  

## Aperature:  
    Think: Dish antena. They have a focused arc of transmission of 105-5 degrees, and usually require a targetting radar when dealing with moving targets.  
    The rule of thumb is: the tighter the arc the higher the range and less noise there is.  
    Transmitters usually use a FCEMP (Focused Cone Electromagnetic Projector), and recievers use a Bowl, or Cone Shaped reflector to focus the signal into a single tight point.  
    This kind of recievers use Amplitude and Frequency Filters to separate the signal.  
    Most models only work on specific frequency bands, and multiple filters and specific reflector tuning are required for multiband support.  

## Monopole:  
    360 degree transmission area with no need for target tracking, But the range is greatly reduced.  
    Filtering is also more rudamentory consisting only of a Frequency filter.  
    They can easily transmitt and recieve multiple frequencies at once even with a single filter.  

## Radio:  
    Due to the extremely low power, robustness, and simplicity the modest radio has enjoyed decent popularity,  
    Every now and then a pirate transmitter can be found and 9 times out of 10 it's something at least a bit entertaining.  
    Higher Frequency variations also exist, for transmitting Analog Television signals.  

## Tanslators:  

## QID; (Quality Improvement Device):  
    Functionally, the object boasts an array of cutting-edge features tailored to its purpose.   
    Equipped with state-of-the-art Language Processing Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence,  
    it possesses an unrivaled ability to decipher and translate diverse languages in real-time.  
    Whether encountering alien dialects or deciphering ancient scripts,  
    this marvel of technology adapts swiftly to the linguistic intricacies of any encountered civilization.  
    Additionally, it connects for a library hub of information where the a.i. can cross compare information to help the user investigate situations.  
    The device itself is not able to scan objects and text, and instead requires the scans to be provided to it by it's interface.  

<!TODO>  

# Radar:  

## Categories:  
- Tracking:  
    Used for Locking in onto a target and Precisely Tracking Their Position and Speed.  
    They suffer from a narrow arc of view.  

- Search:  
    Can Provide Rough locations of multiple Targets within a Broad Area.  

- Scanning:  
    Meant for Providing precise information about The Target.  
    Usually require High exposure times and so they are not well suited for Combat.  

## ERHO; (Extreme Range Hyper Optic):  
    Class of the Highest power and Range Radars. They're able to provide information faster than the speed of light from high distances (3pc), by using a repeated set of Wormholes. Unfortunately this requires the launch of a Primer Missile, and Causes them to Suffer from Blind Spots.  

## PGWD; (Passive Gravitational Wave Detector):  
    Low power Sensor Able to Detect  

## HVPI; (High Velocity Partile Imaging):  
    A method which uses a focused partile projector pointed at the target,   
    and a probe or sreen (for greater resolution) on the other side.  
    A variant of this Method exists called HFRPI (High Frequency Reflective Particle Imaging),  
    which has both the collector and projector stationed at the same side of the object,  
    and uses the high frequency to allow for reflection, allowing for more 'Gentle' scanning of the target.  
    This also makes it more prone to scattering and diffraction... oh and more deadly.  

## Long Range:  
    A High Power class of radars. They're able to detect targets from as far as 8MAU. Their high power of operation makes them Very Easy to detect by anyone within range.  

## Short Range:  
    Standard Mid Power Radars. While they're very difficult to detect the presence of that also limits their range to below 60AU  

## Probes:  
    For when Scanning Radars and not enough. A minature spacecraft equiped with all kinds of sensors, radars, analizers, &c. Usually used for gaining precise data about a planet or any other celestial body.  

## LRNPA: (Long Range Noise Projection Amplifier):  
    A device able of Completely Disabling all Radars and Communications with the use of high frequency Radar Jammers and High Power Decay Projectors. More Advanced Models can Be tuned to Jam only Specific Bands to allow for specific communications while denying others.  

# Computing && AI  

## Quantum Computing:  
    While Most ships have a Minor Quantum Computer installed onboard for more intense computing operations.  
    Their high power draw and need of maintenance keeps regular Silicon Chips still the most common option for most Computational Operations.

## Titles:

### Freeholder:
    The Imperial title of freeholder is used by the Empire to signifies a fully-respected individual.   
    Most Imperial citizens earn it while young through volunteer work or military service.  
    The title is also offered to outsiders who act with honor in the eyes of the Empire.  

### Yeoman: 
    The Imperial title of yeoman is held by those who serve a noble lord in an important, specific way.
    While it is not a noble title, it does give the holder the right to initiate connections the higher ranked.
    This title is often held by senior soldiers, warskiff pilots, spies, advisors, diplomats, intrusion operatives, and other key individuals.
    Many important people spend their entire lives as yeomen, seeking success outside the strictures of nobility.

### Acolyte: 
    The title of acolyte is the first title of noble duty, an encompasses a wide range of practical positions.
    Some acolytes are purely students, learning to lead troops or manage societies.
    Others come from wealthy families and might own city buildings or farm complexes. 
    During wartime, an acolyte might lead a platoon of troops, captain a small frigate, or serve their lord as an advisor. 
    Their low rank within the nobility makes them paradoxically less useful as diplomats than yeomen. 
    Sending a low-ranked acolyte to a negotiation can itself be seen as an insult, whereas a non-noble yeoman negotiator is seen only as the mouthpiece of his lord.

### Knight/Dame: 
    The title of knight is held by nobles who have largely passed their training, but who have not ascended to higher leadership roles. 
    Many knights never advance further, and spend their lives as respected managers, advisors, or warriors. 
    Most knights have some wealth, but a few remain quite poor while others may be very rich. 
    In peacetime, a knight may manage a factory complex, commercial district, or small farming region. 
    In war, some knights lead troop companies and assault squadrons, while others may engage in espionage, sabotage, and space combat.

### Praetor: 
    The title of praetor is a bridge between the service-oriented lower titles below and the power-holding nobility above.
    During peacetime, a praetor will usually manage a city district, asteroid sector, agricultural region, or a space station.
    During war, they take authority over the smallest combat units that fight independently - terrestrial troop cohorts, or space-borne destroyers or combat groups.

### Baron/Baroness: 
    The title of baron is the lowest of the middle nobility.
    While lower titles focus on personal service at war or commerce under a lord, barons hold title as semi-independent rulers.
    Each baron is subordinate to his liege lord, but his obligations are mostly in supplying wealth and troops, and not in personal service.
    In the Empire, a baron will typically own a city sector, mining colony, or similar outfit. 
    At wartime, a baron may captain a capital ship in name, or control a regiment of troops.

### Count/Countess: 
    The title of count is the middle rank of middle nobility. 
    In peacetime, counts hold title to a city or colony, and might have a small personal fleet, possibly including capital ships.

### Duke/Duchess: 
    The Imperial title of duke is the highest of the middle nobility.
    In the Empire, dukes control provinces, mega-cities, moons, or in rarer cases: entire planets.
    At war, a duke can field a division-level force, or a fleet with capital ships and dozens of support craft.

### Consul:
    The Imperial title of consul is a lower level of high nobility. In the Empire, consuls control Solar Systems. 
    At war, a consul can usually field an army-sized force of multiple divisions, supported by several fleets.
    Some command from a super-capital ship or control space-based megastructures.
    
### Stellarch: 
    The Imperial title of stellarch represents dominion over an entire Sector.
    In the Empire, since intergalactic travel times are years long, stellarchs rule their systems with a great degree of independence. 
    They each swear fealty to the Emperor, but since the Emperor may be many light-years away, a stellarch may go years or decades without interacting with him.

### Emperor/Empress: 
    The Imperial title of emperor indicates sovereign dominion over the entire Empire, all its peoples, planets, and fleets. 
    All other lords swear fealty to a high lord, while the Emperor swears fealty to no one. 
    However, even the Emperor depends on the support of lower nobles to remain in power.
